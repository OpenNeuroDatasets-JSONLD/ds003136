I was trying not to laugh at the one clip of my baby, because I remembered that she was pooping at the time! I also though about how much she looks like her father, and how much she has changed from when the clips were taken.	1	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	2	2	3	4	3	n/a	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	2	1	2	4	3	2	3	3	2	1	2	2	2	2	2

I was remembering his reactions.  I was thinking some about how my voice sounded in the video.  Overall I was focused on him and how he was responding, though I had some brief thoughts about an itch on my arm and other little sensations.	1	3	4	4	3	1	2	4	1	1	3	3	2	1	1	3	1	1	1	3	1	2	1	3	1	1	1	3	1	1	2	1	1	1	1	3	3	2	4	2	4	3	3	2	4	2	2

I also was remembering how she looked and how I felt when the video was being filmed, so those memories were triggering feelings as well as just watching the video. It was easy to stay engaged when the video was of my own baby. I was a little distracted by how my voice sounded on the video and how loud it was, and how I startled the baby during peek-a-boo.	1	2	2	3	1	5	4	3	1	2	1	1	3	5	5	3	2	3	1	3	2	4	2	2	1	1	1	1	3	5	5	3	1	1	1	3	3	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	3	3	4

I tried to focus on something else in the video after I saw him crying a few times, because it was too much for me. I tried to focus on the blanket. Focused on the same spot each time it came on. 	1	2	5	5	5	3	3	3	2	2	5	4	3	5	2	2	2	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	3	3	2	n/a	2	3	2	1	3	2	5	3	5	3	4	3	3	5	2	5	3
